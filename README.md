# dgc-pdfjs

Este é um fork do repositório [mozilla/pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)
para ser utilizado como um visualizador integrado à aplicação [D&GConecta](https://dgconecta.com.br).

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). You need to install the gulp package
globally (see also [gulp's getting started](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started)):

    $ npm install -g gulp-cli

If everything worked out, install all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this requires an ES6 compatible browser; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for usage with older browsers.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ gulp generic

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory.
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM and Bower under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `gulp dist-install` command.
